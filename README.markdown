# Exemplar - An iPhone Screen Mocker

Currently it's pretty alpha, but it works. Data is saved to a cookie for now, it will eventually sit on a small Sintra app with DataMapper db.

The code is a bit of mess right now, but the app works.

## Upcoming features

- Sintra + DataMapper Backend
- Gem form for local running (eg run: exemplar #=> http://0.0.0.0:4567)
- Multiple apps
- App flow designer (which buttons activate which windows)
- Simple simulator
