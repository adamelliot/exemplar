# Exemplar - An iPhone Screen Mocker

Currently it's pretty alpha, but it works. Data is saved to a cookie for now, it will eventually sit on a small Sintra app with DataMapper db.

## Issues

The most blaring issue is with scaling. Once scaled down the drag origin is all messed up. It's still functional, but not right. There are other issues, but this is an early alpha, so they'll go away with progress.

## Upcoming features

- Sintra + DataMapper Backend
- Gem form for local running (eg run: exemplar #=> http://0.0.0.0:4567)
- Multiple apps
- App flow designer (which buttons activate which windows)
- Simple simulator
